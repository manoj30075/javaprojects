In the main function, three objects are created, which are independent objects, later, aC is upcasted and
 assigned the reference to aB, similarly aB is upcasted and assigned the reference to aA.

 When aB.aInstanceIntSet(200) and aA.aInstanceIntSet(100) is called aC method will be called to set the aInstanceInt
 variable. So this way all the aInstanceIntSet() method calls will set the value in aC. But when aB.aInstanceInt,
 aA.aInstanceInt and aC.aInstanceInt is set, it directly set the values of each reference object.


 This way all the values are stored in aC, aB and aA
